# ⚙️ CI/CD – Continuous Integration & Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the CI/CD strategy for the E-Commerce Microservices Platform. It ensures that code changes across services are tested, verified, and deployed efficiently, with minimal manual intervention.

---

## 🧱 CI/CD Goals

- 🚀 Fast, automated deployments
- ✅ High test coverage and static analysis
- 🔁 Zero-downtime rolling updates
- 📦 Consistent builds via Docker
- 🔐 Secure secret handling and environment isolation

---

## 🔧 Tooling Overview

| Stage         | Tool                   |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Code Hosting  | GitHub / GitLab        |
| CI Pipelines  | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI |
| Build         | Docker                 |
| Deployment    | Kubernetes + Helm      |
| Secrets       | AWS Secrets Manager / SOPS |
| Monitoring    | Prometheus + Grafana   |

## 🏗️ CI Pipeline – Per Service

Each microservice follows an isolated CI pipeline:

1. **Checkout Code**
2. **Install Dependencies**
3. **Run Unit Tests**
4. **Run Lint & Static Analysis**
5. **Build Docker Image**
6. **Push to Container Registry**
7. **Trigger CD Pipeline**

Example using **GitHub Actions**:

```yaml
name: CI - User Service

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'services/user/**'
      - '.github/workflows/user.yml'

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Run Tests
        run: ./gradlew test
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t myorg/user-service .
      - name: Push Image
        run: docker push myorg/user-service
```

## 🚀 CD Pipeline – Environment Promotion

Deployment is handled via **Helm + Kubernetes** with environment-based values.

### Stages:

- **Dev**: Auto-deployed on merge to `develop`
- **Staging**: Promoted manually or via tag
- **Production**: Tag-based deployment, approval required

### Deployment Features:

- ✅ Canary deployments using Helm
- 🔄 Blue-Green or Rolling updates
- 💥 Rollback support

---

## 🔒 Secret Management

- Environment secrets are stored in:
  - AWS Secrets Manager (preferred)
  - `.env.production` encrypted via Mozilla SOPS
- Decrypted securely in pipeline using IAM roles or GitHub Secrets

---

## 🔁 Database Migrations

- Flyway / Liquibase for SQL DBs
- Migrations run before the service is deployed
- Ensure idempotent scripts for rollback support

---

## 📈 Monitoring Deployments

- Integration with Slack / MS Teams for alerts
- Prometheus tracks deployment success metrics
- Logs tailing for post-deploy health via Fluentd or Loki

---

## 🧪 Best Practices

- Use versioned Docker images (`:v1.2.3`)
- Lock Helm chart versions
- Avoid deploying from local dev machines
- Tag releases with Git (`vX.Y.Z`)
- Apply feature toggles for risky changes

---

## 📦 Directory Structure Suggestion

```text
.github/
  workflows/
    user.yml
    order.yml
    payment.yml

infra/
  helm/
    user-service/
      values.yaml
      Chart.yaml
```

## ✅ Summary

A robust CI/CD pipeline ensures fast delivery, reduces human error, and supports scalability. This setup is designed to support a distributed team, multiple services, and rapid iteration—all while maintaining production-grade safety.
