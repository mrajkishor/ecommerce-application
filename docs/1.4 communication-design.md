# 🔗 Communication Design – E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This document outlines how the services in the system communicate with each other, including both synchronous and asynchronous patterns. It also covers service discovery, API versioning, retries, and fault tolerance strategies.

## 1. 🔁 Communication Patterns

### Synchronous:
- **HTTP/REST** between services
- Used when real-time response is required
- Example: User Service → Auth Service during login

### Asynchronous:
- **Event-driven** using Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Used when eventual consistency is acceptable
- Example: OrderPlaced → InventoryUpdated → SendConfirmationEmail

---

## 2. 🛂 API Gateway Role
- Acts as a reverse proxy to all services
- Handles **authentication, rate limiting, request logging**
- Routes traffic to internal services using URI patterns or service name mapping

Example:
```
POST /api/users/login → User Service
GET  /api/products     → Product Service
```

---

## 3. 🌐 RESTful API Guidelines
- Follow resource-oriented design
- Use plural nouns (`/products`, `/orders`)
- Support filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Standard response structure with metadata

Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Product not found",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

---

## 4. 📬 Async Communication (Event-Driven)

### Use Cases:
- Order created → Reserve inventory
- Payment succeeded → Send invoice
- User registered → Send welcome email

### Sample Event:
```json
{
  "eventType": "OrderPlaced",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-01T12:34:56Z",
  "orderId": "ORD123",
  "userId": "USR456",
  "items": [ ... ]
}
```

---

## 5. 📡 Message Broker Configuration
- **Kafka** is preferred for high throughput, fault-tolerant messaging
- **RabbitMQ** can be used for lightweight routing

### Topics (Kafka):
- `order.events`
- `payment.events`
- `user.signup`

Each service subscribes only to relevant topics (pub/sub model).

---

## 6. 🧯 Error Handling & Retry Strategies
- Implement retries with **exponential backoff** for network/timeouts
- **Dead-letter queues (DLQ)** for failed messages
- Log all failed communication attempts
- Add **circuit breakers** to prevent cascading failures (using Resilience4J/Hystrix)

---

## 7. 🔍 Service Discovery
- Services communicate via **DNS or internal service registry** (e.g., Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes DNS)
- Each service has a stable hostname within the cluster:
  - `user-service.default.svc.cluster.local`

---

## 8. 🧾 API Versioning
- URI-based versioning: `/api/v1/products`
- Header-based versioning also supported: `Accept: application/vnd.app.v1+json`
- Deprecate old versions with clear sunset timelines

---

## 9. 🛡️ Communication Security
- TLS encryption for all REST APIs
- Auth tokens (JWT) verified by API Gateway and downstream services
- Kafka secured using **SASL_SSL and ACLs**
- Rate-limiting and IP whitelisting at the gateway level
