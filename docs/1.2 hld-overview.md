# 🏗️ High-Level Design (HLD) – E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This High-Level Design (HLD) document provides a bird’s-eye view of the architecture, goals, and interactions of the services within the e-commerce platform. It outlines the key system components, communication flows, and foundational design decisions.

---

## 🎯 System Goals

- Build a modular, scalable e-commerce backend
- Ensure high availability and fault tolerance
- Support millions of concurrent users and transactions
- Enable fast development and deployment cycles
- Ensure secure and consistent data handling

---

## 🧱 Architectural Style

- **Microservices**: Independently deployable services
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point to backend APIs
- **Asynchronous Events**: Kafka for decoupled service communication
- **Cloud-Native**: Dockerized, deployed via Kubernetes

## 🔧 Core Components

| Service         | Purpose                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **User**         | User registration, login, profile               |
| **Product**      | Product listing, search, categories             |
| **Order**        | Place/view orders, status tracking              |
| **Payment**      | Payment gateway integration                     |
| **Inventory**    | Stock validation and updates                    |
| **Review**       | Ratings and review system                       |
| **Notification** | Email/SMS push on order/payment events          |
| **Analytics**    | Track user behavior and system usage            |

---

## 🔄 Communication Model

- **Synchronous**: RESTful APIs via API Gateway for client-facing interactions
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka-based pub/sub between internal services
- **Idempotent endpoints** for retry support

## 💾 Storage Design

| Component       | Storage               | Reason                       |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| User/Auth       | PostgreSQL             | Structured, relational data  |
| Product         | MongoDB                | Flexible product schema      |
| Order/Payment   | PostgreSQL             | ACID-compliant transactions  |
| Inventory       | PostgreSQL             | Accurate stock state         |
| Caching         | Redis                  | Fast access, rate-limiting   |

---

## 🛡️ Security Overview

- **JWT-based auth** via Auth Service
- HTTPS enforced for all services
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secrets managed using AWS Secrets Manager or Vault

---

## 🧪 Observability and Monitoring

- **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics
- **Loki or ELK stack** for logs
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing
- **Alertmanager** integrated with Slack/email for incident response

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

- **CI/CD via GitHub Actions**
- **Docker + Helm + Kubernetes**
- Multi-environment setup (dev, staging, prod)
- Rolling updates with Helm and health checks

---

## 🧠 Tradeoffs & Design Principles

- Consistency > Availability for transactional flows (CAP)
- Eventual consistency for non-critical paths
- Lightweight communication between services (REST + Kafka)
- Secure defaults with flexible configuration

## 🧭 Conclusion

This HLD document provides a scalable, secure, and extensible foundation for building and growing a modern e-commerce platform using microservices architecture. Future improvements may include AI-powered recommendations, dynamic pricing, and serverless workflows for async tasks.
