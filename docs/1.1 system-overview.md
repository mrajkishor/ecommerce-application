## 1. 🎯 Objectives & Goals
- Design a highly modular, scalable, and maintainable e-commerce system.
- Support millions of users and concurrent transactions.
- Enable independent development and deployment of features.
- Ensure security, fault tolerance, and observability.

## 2. 🧱 Architectural Style & Decisions
- **Microservices Architecture**: Services are domain-driven and independently deployable.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Services communicate asynchronously using Kafka/RabbitMQ.
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point to route and secure HTTP requests.
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Right tool for the right job (SQL, NoSQL, Caching).

## 4. 🧩 Core Components & Their Roles
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to the appropriate service. Handles auth, rate-limiting.
- **Auth Service**: Handles JWT-based authentication, token validation.
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, registration, and access roles.
- **Product Service**: Manages catalog, product metadata, categories.
- **Order Service**: Tracks cart, orders, and order history.
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments via Stripe/Razorpay.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages product stock and availability.
- **Review Service**: Stores product ratings, feedback.
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications.

## 5. 🔗 Communication (REST & Async)
- **Sync**: Internal REST API communication via service discovery (or gRPC).
- **Async**: Kafka for events like `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentSuccess`, etc.
- **Retry Strategy**: Backoff with retries on failure (exponential).

## 6. ⚙️ Deployment Strategy (Dev → Prod)
- **Dev**: Docker Compose
- **Staging**: Kubernetes cluster with mocked external APIs
- **Prod**: Kubernetes on AWS/GCP with Helm, load balancers, and auto-scaling groups
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions or GitLab

## 7. 🛡️ Authentication & Security Model
- JWT Auth tokens signed by Auth Service
- OAuth2 support (Google, Facebook)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- TLS everywhere (internal + external)
- API Gateway enforces auth and rate limiting

## 8. 📦 Tech Stack Summary
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Java (Spring Boot)
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Messaging**: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

## 9. 🔄 Future Scope & Extensibility
- ML recommendations and personalization
- Globalization support (multi-language, multi-currency)
- Modular plug-ins for analytics, marketing, and offers
- Headless CMS integration

## 10. 🧠 Design Tradeoffs Considered
- **Microservices vs Monolith**: Chose microservices for scalability at the cost of complexity.
- **Kafka vs REST-only**: Chose Kafka for decoupled async flows and better fault tolerance.
- **Polyglot DB vs Single DB**: Chose per-service DB for isolation and flexibility.

## 11. 🧪 Preparedness for Scale
- Auto-scaling enabled with HPA/KEDA
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling + Database connection pooling
- Load balancing via NGINX + ALB
- Rate-limiting and circuit breaking at API Gateway
- Performance tested with 10M simulated users (Artillery/Locust)
