# 📋 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements – E-Commerce Platform

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the e-commerce microservices platform to guide architectural decisions and ensure alignment with business and performance expectations.

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

- Users can register, log in, and manage their profile.
- Users can browse the product catalog with search and filters.
- Users can add products to the cart and place orders.
- Orders are validated, stored, and processed asynchronously.
- Users can make payments using cards, UPI, or wallets.
- Order statuses can be tracked in real time.
- Admins can manage product listings and inventory.
- Users can leave reviews and ratings on products.
- Email/SMS notifications are sent for order confirmation and delivery.
- Order history and invoices can be retrieved by the user.
- Admins can generate sales and inventory reports via analytics service.

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

- ⚙️ **Scalability**: The system must handle 1 million+ users per day with horizontal scalability.
- ⚡ **Performance**: 95% of user-facing API calls should respond within 300ms.
- 🛡️ **Security**:
  - All APIs must be protected via JWT-based authentication.
  - User passwords are hashed (bcrypt or Argon2).
  - Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent.
- 🔐 **Data Privacy**:
  - PII data should be masked or encrypted at rest.
  - All sensitive data should be transmitted over HTTPS.
- 💥 **Resilience**:
  - Circuit breakers and retries must be in place for external service calls.
  - No single point of failure should exist.
- 📊 **Availability**:
  - Core services (Order, Payment, Auth) must ensure 99.9% uptime.
- 📦 **Durability**:
  - Order and payment data must be persisted using ACID-compliant storage.
  - Message queues must ensure at-least-once delivery.
- 🔍 **Observability**:
  - Logs must be centralized and searchable for 14 days minimum.
  - Metrics and health indicators must be available in Grafana.
- 📈 **Extensibility**:
  - The system should allow easy onboarding of new payment gateways or delivery partners.

## 🧠 Design Assumptions

- System will be deployed on Kubernetes-managed cloud infrastructure.
- Payments will be simulated via sandbox environments for testing.
- User data is region-specific; multi-region availability is a future scope.
