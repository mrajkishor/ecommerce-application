# ⚖️ Design Tradeoffs – E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This document highlights the major architectural and engineering trade-offs made in designing the e-commerce microservices system. These decisions are informed by principles like CAP theorem, SCARD, PACELC, and practical production constraints.

---

## 📚 1. CAP Theorem

CAP: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance (pick 2)

### Decision:
- Prioritized **Consistency + Partition Tolerance (CP)** in services like Order and Payment.
- **Availability** can be sacrificed slightly in favor of accurate state (no duplicate payments or inconsistent order status).

---

## ⚙️ 2. SCARD Principles

**SCARD** = Scalability, Consistency, Availability, Reliability, Durability

| Property       | How It's Achieved                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalability    | Stateless services, Kubernetes HPA, Kafka-based events |
| Consistency    | Strong consistency in DB writes, Idempotency keys      |
| Availability   | Load balancers, retries, async queues                  |
| Reliability    | Circuit breakers, retry policies, monitoring/alerts    |
| Durability     | PostgreSQL with backups, persistent queues             |

## 📊 3. PACELC Trade-Offs

**PACELC**: If there is a Partition, choose between Availability and Consistency. Else, choose between Latency and Consistency.

### Application:
- **Order/Payment Services** prefer Consistency over Latency.
- **Search/Product Catalog** services prefer Low Latency and Eventual Consistency.

---

## 🔁 4. Sync vs Async Communication

### Trade-Off:
- **Sync**: Simpler logic, faster error handling.
- **Async**: More scalable, decoupled, but adds complexity.

### Design:
- Used **sync** for user → order interactions.
- Used **Kafka-based async** for Order → Inventory, Order → Payment flows.

---

## 💾 5. Database Choice

- **PostgreSQL** for transactional services (Order, Payment).
- **MongoDB** for flexible-schema services (Product Catalog).
- **Redis** for caching, rate-limiting, and session storage.

**Trade-Off**: Managed multiple storage engines for optimal performance vs added ops complexity.

---

## 🌍 6. Eventual Consistency

- Services like Order and Payment use **eventual consistency** across boundaries.
- Ensures the system is **resilient and available** even under partial failure.

**Mitigation**: Used **idempotent operations**, **deduplication**, and **message retries**.

---

## 🧪 7. Testing & Resilience

- Simpler logic makes unit and integration testing easier.
- Async flow requires **mocking Kafka**, **ensuring retries**, and **chaos testing**.

---

## 🛡️ 8. Security vs Developer Velocity

- Chose **JWT-based auth** for simplicity and performance.
- Secrets managed via **AWS Secrets Manager** to ensure secure CI/CD.

---

## ✅ Summary

Design trade-offs are crucial in balancing performance, reliability, and developer experience. This architecture prefers:
- **Consistency over availability** where needed (payments)
- **Event-driven async systems** for better decoupling
- **Strong monitoring and fallback logic** for operational safety

These choices reflect a real-world approach to scalable, production-ready systems.
