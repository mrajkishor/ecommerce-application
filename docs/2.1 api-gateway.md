# 🌐 API Gateway – E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This document describes the design, responsibilities, and implementation strategies of the API Gateway component in the system. It acts as the single entry point for client interactions and routes requests to appropriate backend services.

## 1. 🔗 Role of API Gateway
- Acts as the entry point for all external client requests
- Forwards valid requests to backend microservices
- Provides cross-cutting concerns like auth, logging, rate limiting

---

## 2. 🧭 Key Responsibilities
- Reverse proxy
- URI routing
- JWT validation
- Request size checks
- Response formatting
- Service fallback handling

---

## 3. 🛣️ Routing Strategies
- Path-based routing (e.g., `/api/products → Product Service`)
- Subdomain-based routing (optional)
- Weighted routing for canary deployments

### Sample Mapping:
```
/api/users       → User Service
/api/products    → Product Service
/api/orders      → Order Service
/api/payments    → Payment Service
```

---

## 4. 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Validates JWTs via the Auth Service
- Rejects expired/invalid tokens before forwarding
- Injects user context (userId, role) into headers for downstream use

---

## 5. 🚦 Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Global and per-user rate limits
- Token bucket algorithm to support bursts
- Configurable per endpoint

### Example:
- `/api/products`: 100 req/min/user
- `/api/orders`: 30 req/min/user

---

## 6. 🔁 Request/Response Transformation
- Add/remove headers (e.g., X-Request-ID)
- Rewrite paths if needed
- Format errors in consistent JSON format

---

## 7. 🧯 Error Handling
- Standardized error response for all services
- Catch-all fallback for downstream failures
- Graceful error messages (avoid leaking stack traces)

```json
{
  "statusCode": 503,
  "message": "Service temporarily unavailable",
  "error": true
}
```

---

## 8. 🛡️ Security Practices
- Enforce HTTPS
- IP allow/block lists
- CORS enforcement
- Header sanitization to avoid injection

---

## 9. 📊 Logging & Observability
- Generate a `requestId` and propagate across services
- Log incoming requests, outgoing responses, and errors
- Integrate with centralized logging (ELK or Loki)

---

## 10. 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **NGINX**: Lightweight reverse proxy
- **Kong** / **Traefik**: API gateway with plugins
- **AWS API Gateway**: For serverless usage
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: If using Spring ecosystem
