## 1. 🔐 Authentication & Token Management
- JWT tokens issued by Auth Service
- Tokens include userId, role, issuedAt, expiry
- Short-lived access tokens + optional refresh tokens
- Blacklist on logout using Redis or DynamoDB

---

## 2. 👤 Authorization & RBAC
- Roles: `admin`, `user`, `vendor`, `support`
- Services enforce access based on roles
- Fine-grained control per endpoint
- Example:
  - Only `admin` can `DELETE /products/:id`
  - `vendor` can `POST /products`

---

## 3. 🔒 Secure Communication
- All internal and external traffic over HTTPS
- TLS termination at load balancer or API Gateway
- Internal mTLS (mutual TLS) for sensitive service-to-service communication

---

## 4. 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization
- Validate all incoming data via schemas (e.g., Joi, Zod)
- Escape output to prevent XSS
- Use parameterized queries/ORMs to prevent SQL Injection
- Limit request body size and file uploads

---

## 5. 🗃️ Data Protection & Storage
- Sensitive fields (e.g., password, card details) are hashed/encrypted
- Use `bcrypt` or `argon2` for password hashing
- Use AWS KMS or similar for symmetric encryption
- No sensitive data stored in logs or URLs

---

## 6. 🛡️ API Security Best Practices
- Use HTTP-only, secure cookies for session tokens if applicable
- Enable CORS only for trusted origins
- Reject invalid or expired JWTs
- Remove X-Powered-By headers
- Apply schema validation before processing business logic

---

## 7. 🚦 Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
- Token bucket algorithm via API Gateway
- Per-IP/user limits
- CAPTCHA enforcement on sensitive endpoints (e.g., login)
- Temporary account locking on brute-force login attempts

---

## 8. 🔑 Secrets Management
- Environment variables never committed to version control
- Use AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or SSM Parameter Store
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit

---

## 9. 🧪 Dependency & Vulnerability Scanning
- Enable automated scans (e.g., Snyk, GitHub Dependabot)
- Monitor for outdated packages or known CVEs
- Avoid deprecated libraries
- Run container image vulnerability scans

---

## 10. 📋 Security Monitoring & Auditing
- Centralized logging for all services (via ELK)
- Audit trail of key user actions (e.g., login, orders, refunds)
- Alerts on suspicious patterns (e.g., geo anomalies, too many failed logins)
- Regular penetration tests and threat modeling
