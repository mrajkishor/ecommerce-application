# 📊 Monitoring & Observability – E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This document outlines the monitoring, logging, and alerting setup for the e-commerce microservices system to ensure high availability, performance tracking, and rapid incident response.

---

## 🎯 Monitoring Goals

- 📈 Track system health and service performance
- 🚨 Alert on failures, slowdowns, and errors
- 🔍 Enable deep debugging and traceability
- 📦 Centralize logs and metrics for all microservices

---

## 🧰 Tooling Stack

| Function            | Tool/Service              |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Metrics             | Prometheus                |
| Dashboards          | Grafana                   |
| Logging             | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki |
| Tracing             | Jaeger / AWS X-Ray        |
| Alerts              | Alertmanager / PagerDuty / Slack |
| Health Checks       | Kubernetes Probes + Custom Endpoints |

## 📦 Metrics Collection

Each service exposes `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus format).  
Prometheus scrapes these metrics periodically.

### Common Metrics:
- HTTP request count / status codes
- API latency (p95, p99)
- DB query times and counts
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- Kafka consumer lag
- Custom business metrics (orders placed, payments failed)

---

## 📊 Grafana Dashboards

Grafana connects to Prometheus and Elasticsearch (or Loki) for visualization.

### Suggested Dashboards:
- Global Service Health
- Per-service HTTP status breakdown
- Payment failures & retries
- Inventory updates vs order placements
- Alerts Overview

---

## 📂 Logging Strategy

Use structured JSON logging with service name, timestamp, traceId, log level, and message.

### Logging Flow:
```
App (structured logs) → Fluent Bit / Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana
```

OR (lightweight):
```
App → Loki → Grafana Logs
```

### Log Levels:
- INFO: General events
- WARN: Recoverable issues
- ERROR: Failed transactions
- DEBUG: Verbose for dev environments

---

## 📈 Tracing (Distributed)

Use **OpenTelemetry + Jaeger** to trace calls across microservices.

### Key Concepts:
- `traceId`: Follows a request across services
- `spanId`: Individual service operation

Enables flame graphs, latency bottleneck analysis, and root cause detection.

---

## 🚨 Alerts & Incident Response

Use **Prometheus Alertmanager** or integrate with **PagerDuty**, **Slack**, or **email**.

### Example Alerts:
- High 5xx error rate from API Gateway
- DB query latency > 500ms
- Payment service unresponsive
- Kafka lag threshold breached

---

## 🧪 Health Checks

Each service must implement:

- `/healthz`: Liveness check
- `/readyz`: Readiness check
- Kubernetes uses these for pod restarts and service discovery

---

## 🛠 Best Practices

- Correlate logs with traceId for full request visibility
- Store logs for at least 14 days
- Anonymize PII in logs
- Create alerts with actionable context
- Use dashboards during incident reviews and postmortems

---

## ✅ Summary

A robust monitoring and observability stack enables fast recovery, better uptime, and proactive issue detection. This setup ensures production-grade visibility across your distributed architecture.
