## 1. 🎯 Scalability Goals
- Handle 10M+ users and 1M+ concurrent sessions
- Sub-second response times under high load
- Modular scale-up/down of services independently

---

## 2. ⚖️ Load Balancing
- NGINX or AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Service-level load balancing via Kubernetes Services
- Weighted routing for gradual rollouts

---

## 3. 📈 Auto-Scaling
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- KEDA for event-driven scaling (Kafka message rate)
- Min/max replica configuration to prevent overconsumption

---

## 4. 🗃️ Database Scalability
- PostgreSQL read replicas for heavy read operations
- Sharding based on user ID or region (future roadmap)
- MongoDB with replica sets and horizontal scaling
- Use of Amazon RDS/Aurora with Multi-AZ

---

## 5. ⚡ Caching Strategy
- Redis for in-memory caching (sessions, hot products, frequently accessed data)
- Cache aside (lazy loading) pattern
- TTL and eviction policies for freshness

Examples:
- `GET /products` → Cache product metadata
- `GET /users/:id` → Cache user profiles

---

## 6. 🚦 Rate Limiting
- Enforced at API Gateway level
- Token bucket algorithm to allow burst traffic
- Per-user/IP throttling based on usage tier

---

## 7. 🧯 Fault Tolerance
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Dead-letter queues (DLQ) in message brokers
- Graceful degradation (e.g., show cached results if live service fails)

---

## 8. 🛑 Circuit Breakers
- Implemented using Resilience4J or Hystrix
- Open circuit after N failures to avoid cascading failure
- Half-open state for recovery probing
- Dashboard to monitor circuit states

---

## 9. 🛡️ Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Daily backups of all critical DBs (RDS, MongoDB, Redis snapshots)
- Multi-AZ deployments for HA
- Restore runbooks and data integrity verification

---

## 10. ⚙️ Chaos Testing
- Periodically simulate failures using tools like Chaos Monkey or Litmus
- Inject latency, kill pods, disconnect DBs
- Monitor recovery metrics and alert triggers
