9. [ ] [💬 Review Service (Node.js)](https://github.com/mrajkishor/ecommerce-application/issues/6)  
   _Optional but valuable — depends on user and product services._

10. [ ] [📧 Notification Service (Node.js)](https://github.com/mrajkishor/ecommerce-application/issues/10)

13. [ ] [🔐 Security](https://github.com/mrajkishor/ecommerce-application/issues/14)  
   _Add RBAC, JWT verification, API protection (builds on auth & gateway)._

14. [ ] [📈 Monitoring](https://github.com/mrajkishor/ecommerce-application/issues/15)
